# MARGARITAS BAR WEBSITE


Welcome to "LucÃ­a's Margaritas"!

This is the website for a cocktail bar that doesn't exist (yet), specializing in margaritas.

It's a dynamic site where the first thing users see is the margarita menu, as margaritas are the house specialty. If the user has previously created a list of their favorite cocktails during their last visit, that list will also be displayed.

In addition to margaritas, many other cocktails are available, so users can search the extensive menu, for example, by typing "mojito" to see the mojitos on offer.

To remember which cocktails they liked, users can mark them as favorites. These favorites will change their appearance in the original list and will appear in a new list of favorites on the left.

This list will be saved in localStorage so that whenever our users visit or refresh the page, their favorites will still be there.

Of course, if a cocktail is no longer a favorite, each one has a cross icon that removes it from the list when clicked, a cross icon that clears all favorites, and a reset button to clear the search field and start a new search.
